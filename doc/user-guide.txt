= WebROaR User Guide =

== Introduction ==


http://webroar.in[WebROaR] is an application server that makes deployments of 
ruby web applications extremely simple. It provides an integrated solution to 
view the run time performance numbers and sends email notifications in case any 
exceptions occur in any of the deployed applications.

It is 5 to 55% faster than all other comparable deployment stacks for 
Ruby on Rails applications.

=== Key Features ===

* Maximum Performance. 
* Simplified Deployment.
* Runs Ruby on Rails(TM) as well as other Rack compliant applications. 
* Run Multiple Applications Simultaneously. 
* Implements HTTP/1.1 grammar as per RFC 2616 including support for persistent,
 and chunked requests. 
* Intelligent load balancing and dynamic reaping of stuck ruby processing
 instances. 
* Provides run time performance data for the deployed applications. 
* Generates notifications in case any exceptions occur in any of the deployed
 applications.
* SSL support. 

== Supported Operating Systems ==

WebROaR has been tested on Ubuntu 8.10/9.04/9.10, Debian 5 (64 Bit), Mac OS X 
(v10.5 & v10.6), Arch Linux 2009.08 and Cent OS 5.2. Basically, it should be 
able to run on any *IX OS.  

Currently it does not support Microsoft(R) Windows.

== Install ==


=== Prerequisites ===


- ruby 1.8.x or 1.9.x 
- ruby 1.8-dev or 1.9-dev 
- openssl ruby extension (On Ubuntu/Debian it is available as libopenssl-ruby1.X)
- zlib ruby extension
- rubygems
- C build tools (gcc etc) (e.g. build-essential on Ubuntu, Xcode on MacOS)
- libsqlite3
- libsqlite3-dev
- gnutls 2.4.1 or later (Only necessary in case SSL support is required) 
- gnutls-dev 2.4.1 or later (Only necessary in case SSL support is required) 

[NOTE]
.Ruby Shared Library
===============================
The server needs the shared library - libruby.so to run the ruby web 
applications.

If you are building ruby from source, please ensure you pass the flag 
*--enable-shared* while executing its ./configure script.

===============================

=== Procedure ===

WebROaR can be installed through its gem or directly from its source code. One 
can also use Capistrano to perform a non-interactive installation of the 
server.

==== Install using gem ====

WebROaR can be installed using the following commands:

----
sudo gem install webroar
sudo webroar install
----

[NOTE] 
.SSL Support
===============================
In case you would like to setup SSL support for the server, use the following
command line switch with *sudo webroar install* command mentioned above.
----
sudo webroar install --ssl-support
----

Configure further SSL options in the server's admin panel
	*http://<yourservername>:<port>/admin-panel/configuration*

After restarting the server, admin panel would now also be accessible over SSL.
*https://<yourservername>:<port>/admin-panel*
===============================

==== Install from source code ====

If you like living in the fast lane, you can install the edge version giving
the following commands:

----
git clone git://github.com/webroar/webroar.git
cd webroar
sudo rake install
----

[NOTE]
.SSL Support
===============================
To build with SSL support, use the following additional switch with the 
*sudo rake install* command:
----
sudo rake install ssl=yes
----

Configure further SSL options in the server's admin panel
	*http://<yourservername>:<port>/admin-panel/configuration*

After restarting the server, admin panel would now also be accessible over SSL.
*https://<yourservername>:<port>/admin-panel*
===============================

==== Non-Interactive Install using Capistrano ====

You can use following Capistrano script to install the edge version on a 
remote machine

. Create folder <dir>, move to <dir> folder using *cd <dir>*.
. Apply command *capify .*
. Replace the content of *config/deploy.rb* with the following script

----
. Set the variables in *config/deploy.rb* file.
. To setup the fresh directory structure on the remote machine run 
*cap deploy:setup*
. To deploy the application for the first time run *cap deploy:cold*
  (Steps 1-6 are to be followed only once to create directory setup on remote 
  machine.)
. Update the current version with the latest code from github using 
*cap deploy:update*.

=== Troubleshooting ===

[IMPORTANT]
It is suggested that rubygems software should be setup correctly 
beforehand, and you should be successfully able to access and use the already 
installed gems. (If you use Ubuntu, you might be able to relate to this point
better.) 

- In case auto-installation of dependent gems fails (due to some prehistoric 
rubygems version or any other reason), you can install the following dependent
 gems individually first:

 calendar_date_select, rack, rake, rspec, sqlite3-ruby, starling-starling, will_paginate

- After successful installation of the webroar gem, any errors that occur
during the setup are saved to the install.log created in the installed gem's 
directory. This can be used to troubleshoot the issues, if any.

- All run time logs for the server and the deployed applications can be found 
in */var/log/webroar*. In the unfortunate event of the server crashing, a core 
dump file would be created in /tmp if 'gcore' is available on that machine.


=== Setting up database for server admin panel ===


The server's admin panel itself is a Ruby on Rails(TM) web application, and by 
default uses sqlite as it's database. You can edit 
*admin_panel/config/database.yml* to setup a database of your liking and 
follow it up by running these commands from the *admin_panel* directory.

----
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
----

*admin_panel* directory would be present under the server's rubygem 
directory.

== Usage ==

Start/Stop/Restart WebROaR:

----
sudo webroar start
sudo webroar stop
sudo webroar restart
----

Start/Stop/Restart a deployed application:

----
sudo webroar start <Application Name>
sudo webroar stop <Application Name>
sudo webroar restart <Application Name>
----

[NOTE]
===============================
You can stop the admin panel application of the server any time, to conserve 
resources and ensure better security.

----
sudo webroar stop "Admin Panel"
----

To start it whenever you want, use the following command:

----
sudo webroar start "Admin Panel"
----

Please note that analytics data and exceptions are still captured by the 
server even when the admin panel is stopped.
===============================

== Deploying applications ==

=== Deploy using Admin Panel ===

If the server got installed successfully, you should be able access it's admin
panel using the link: + 
*http://<yourservername>:<port>/admin-panel*

You can log in with the administrator account username and password that you 
had entered during server installation. Deploy the ruby web application of 
your choice accessing the *Configuration* link of the admin panel.

[TIP]
You do *"not"* need to restart the server when you deploy a new application.
The application starts up automatically after deployment.

=== Deploy using Capistrano ===

WebROaR can be easily integrated with Capistrano using the following 
instructions.

After installing Capistrano, run the following command in your application's 
root directory:

----
capify .
----

It would create *Capfile* and *config/deploy.rb* files.
Modify *config/deploy.rb* file as shown below:

----
set :application, "myapp"

set :scm,:none
set :repository, "."

set :copy_cache, "/tmp/my-app"
set :copy_compression,:gzip
set :deploy_via,:copy
set :copy_exclude, [".git/*", "log/*", "Capfile", "config/deploy.rb", "*~", ".*"]

set :password, 'password'
set :use_sudo, false
set :user, 'username'
set :port, 22

set :deploy_to, "path-to-your-web-app-directory/#{application}"

################################
# Parameters used to add application to the server
################################
set :resolver, "/#{application.gsub(' ','_')}"
set :path, "#{deploy_to}/current"
set :app_type, "rails"
set :environment, "production"
set :analytics, "--analytics" # ' ' (blank) to disable analytics
set :min_workers, "4"
set :max_workers, "8"
set :run_as_user, "#{user}"
################################

role :app, "server"
role :web, "server"
role :db,  "server", :primary => true

#role :db,  "your slave db-server here"

namespace :deploy do

  [:stop, :start, :restart].each do |action|
    desc "#{action.to_s.capitalize} the application."
    task action, :roles => :app do
      run "#{sudo} webroar #{action.to_s} #{application.to_s}"
    end
  end

  desc "Add application to the server"
  task :add, :roles => :app do
    run "#{sudo} webroar add '#{application}' --resolver'#{resolver}' \
    --path'#{path}' -type'#{app_type}' -environment'#{environment}' #{analytics} \
    --min-workers#{min_workers} --max-workers#{max_workers} \
    --run-as-user'#{run_as_user}'"
  end

  desc "Remove application from the server"
  task :remove, :roles => :app do
    run "#{sudo} webroar remove '#{application}'"
  end

end

after "deploy:update",  "deploy:restart"

----

Create the application directory structure by running setup command:

----
cap deploy:setup
----

Deploy the application using command:

----
cap deploy
----

Add the application to WebROaR:

----
cap deploy:add
----

Please note that the application needs to be added to the server only once.

You can use the following commands for starting/stopping/restarting the 
application while upgrading it in the future:

----
cap deploy:stop
cap deploy:start
cap deploy:restart
----


=== Rack applications (other than Rails) ===

To deploy any Rack based application (other than Rails) the following are 
required in it's root directory:

- *public* folder containing static files like images and stylesheets
- *config.ru* - the Rackup file for starting the application. This file must 
contain the complete logic for initializing the application.

Here are some examples of the Rackup files:

*Merb*

----
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'merb-core'
  Merb::Config.setup(:merb_root   => ENV['APP_ROOT'],
                     :environment => ENV['APP_ENV'],
                     :path_prefix => ENV['APP_BASE_URI'])
  Merb.environment = Merb::Config[:environment]
  Merb.root = Merb::Config[:merb_root]
  Merb::BootLoader.run
  run Merb::Rack::Application.new
----

*Sinatra*

----
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'rack'
  require 'sinatra'  
  set :env, ENV['APP_ENV'] || :production  
  set :raise_errors, true  
  run Sinatra::Application
----

You can use following environment variables in *config.ru* to access the few
application configuration parameters given at a time of application deployment
in WebROaR.

- ENV[\'APP_ROOT\'] - To get the application root
- ENV[\'APP_ENV\'] - To get the application environment
- ENV[\'APP_BASE_URI\'] - To get the baseuri

== Accessing run time statistics ==

For those applications whose Analytics are *Enabled* in their configuration,
the following graphs are available under the *Analytics* link of the admin panel.

. URL Breakdown
. Most Time Consuming URLs
. URL Hits
. Slowest URLs
. Top Database Consuming URLs
. Percentage Time Spent in Database Layer
. Average Response Time
. Peak Requests in Second
. Percentage CPU Utilization
. Physical Memory Utilization

Additionally, CPU and Physical Memory usage graphs for the entire server are
also available. 

[NOTE]
Currently, Analytics are only supported for Ruby on Rails(TM) applications. 
Also, after a specific request has been processed by the server, it takes 
about a minute for it’s data to show up in the graphs.

== Exception Tracking and Notifications ==

Any exceptions that occur in any of the deployed application are captured by 
the server. An email notification is also sent out immediately with details of 
the exception, if the mail settings have been configured in the admin panel. 

All the exceptions can be seen under the *Exceptions* link of the server admin 
panel.

[NOTE]
Currently, this feature is only supported for Ruby on Rails(TM) applications. 
Also, it takes about a minute for an exception to show up in the Admin Panel 
after it has occurred.

== Uninstall ==

If you didn't like the server, use the following commands in sequence to 
uninstall it. 

----
sudo webroar uninstall
sudo gem uninstall webroar
----

== Test Suite ==

If you are a programmer and wish to play around with the server's code, you 
might like to use it's test suite to test the robustness of your changes.

It can be run using the following command:

----
sudo webroar test	
----

We execute this suite on our nightly builds and it currently has the following 
tests:

- Unit Tests
- Functional Tests
- Admin-Panel Tests
- Load Test I - Continuous run
- Load Test II - Random sleep interval run
- Build Tests

  Arguments:
    APPNAME       Name of the application

  Options:
    -R, --resolver
          Resolver to identify the application. Set it to '/' if you would like 
          to run the application on the root domain. e.g. http://yourserver:port/.
          Else set the relevant base URI with which you would like to access the 
          application, e.g. '/app1' if you want the application to be accessible 
          via http://yourserver:port/app1.
          If you would like to set a virtual host for your application e.g. 
          www.company1.com, please specify it here. You can also host this 
          application on a particular subdomain e.g. app1.company1.com. 
          Wildcard '*' can also be used in defining the virtual host name, 
          but it should only be used either at the start or the end. Prefix the 
          virtual host name with tilde(~), if a wildcard is used in defining it. 
          e.g. (i) ~*.server.com (ii) ~www.server.* (iii) ~*.server.*
    -D, --path
          Complete path for your application root directory: e.g. 
          /home/someuser/webapps/app1
    -U, --run-as-user
