Usage
=====

After installation process you need to add 'before_filter' callback in your
controller to create question captcha before the processing of specified actions.

Suppose you have a CommentsController in which you want to create capthca question
for "new" action so just add the following lines in your controller.

class CommentsController << ActionController::Base
  before_filter :create_question_captcha, :only => [:new]
  # ....
  # ....
end

And for validation of captcha text you need to call validate_captcha funtion in
the required action. Lets say in "create" action of CommentsController you want 
to apply captcha validation, so do the following addition in your 'create' action.


class CommentsController << ActionController::Base
  before_filter :create_question_captcha, :only => [:new]

  def new
    # action related data
  end
  # other action methods

  def create
    if validate_captcha_answer
      # ........
    else
      # ........
    end
  end
end

And add the following line in your html view to create captcha image.

<%= text_captcha_tag %>

If captcha validation failes then text captcha plugin set the error message in 
flash[:notice] variable, so you should use flash[:notice] variable in your form
for the notification of captcha failure message.

<%= flash[:notice] if flash[:notice] %>
