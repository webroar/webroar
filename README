Introduction
-------------

WebROaR is an application server that makes deployments of ruby web 
applications extremely simple. It provides an integrated solution to view 
the run time performance numbers and email notifications in case any 
exceptions occur in any of the deployed applications.

It is 5 to 55% faster than all other comparable deployment stacks for 
Ruby on Rails applications.
