Introduction
-------------

WebROaR is an application server that makes deployments of ruby web 
applications extremely simple. It provides an integrated solution to view 
the run time performance numbers and email notifications in case any 
exceptions occur in any of the deployed applications.

It is 5 to 55% faster than all other comparable deployment stacks for 
Ruby on Rails applications.

Check out http://webroar.in and doc/user-guide.html for more details.

- openssl ruby extension (On Ubuntu/Debian it is available as libopenssl-ruby1.X)
- zlib ruby extension
- rubygems
- C build tools (gcc etc) (e.g. build-essential on Ubuntu, Xcode on MacOS)
- libsqlite3
- libsqlite3-dev
- gnutls 2.4.1 or later (Only necessary in case SSL support is required) 
- gnutls-dev 2.4.1 or later (Only necessary in case SSL support is required)

.SSL Support
===============================
In case you would like to setup SSL support for the server, use the following
command line switch with *sudo webroar install* command mentioned above.
----
sudo webroar install --ssl-support
----

Configure further SSL options in the server's admin panel
  *http://<yourservername>:<port>/admin-panel/configuration*

After restarting the server, admin panel would now also be accessible over SSL.
